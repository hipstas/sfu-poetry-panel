1976.274524		IL: I’ll try to keep this from a descent into self-indulgent nostalgia. The fact is that I’m here tonight entirely through an accident, but I did write a poem some time ago called “Fortuna Et Cupidas” or “Chance and Appetite.” It’s a chance that I’m a poet. And it came about because my sister-in-law Eckie was working the Diana Grill in Montreal and at that same place John Sutherland’s sister Betty was also working as a hat-check girl. And one day I was on furlough and my sister-in-law Eckie told me, “you know there’s somebody working at Diana Grill who’s as crazy as you are. You ought to meet her.” And of course that was an invitation I couldn’t refuse so I met Betty and I embraced her the first time I saw her and I said, “You and I will have beautiful children, a prophecy that was fulfilled.”	Layton
2040.104663		So through Betty I met John [Sutherland] who had just started First Statement because, as Sandra’s told you, his poems had been rejected by Preview. And I became a member of the editorial board and I had met Louis Dudek when I was at McGill before I went into the army and so I said to Louis, who at that time was working in the Sun Life Building, “Why don’t you come along and join up?” And so he did. And so we had the group. The trio of John Sutherland, Louis Dudek, and myself, and then there was John Sutherland’s girlfriend who became his wife, Audrey Aikman and my wife Betty Sutherland. We composed the editorial board of First Statement.	Layton
2088.771253		There were several things that bound us together. One, our opposition to Canadian gentility. The feeling that there had to be a gap where some people believed, especially the academics, who were mostly English. You must remember what the period is. Most of the heads of the Canadian universities were imported from Great Britain. Just as now some of them are imported from the United States of America. And they, in turn, imported teachers, instructors, also from Great Britain. And they had absolutely no use for Canadian literature—it didn’t exist. And so we were protesting against that: the gentility that separated culture from reality. That’s how I define both gentility and academicism. And the three of us felt—we all felt—that this was bad.	Layton
2149.73682		The other thing that bound us together was the desire to create a national poetry. Not nationalistic—a distinction that has to be made. We weren’t going to keep out foreign influences. On the contrary, we were very much interested in what was happening in the United States, and to distinguish ourselves from Preview, I would say that we were more interested in the American poets like Cummings and Frost, and Hart Crane, and of course, the father of them all, Walt Whitman, than we were in the English poets. We felt that the Preview poets were very much oriented towards W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot. I had very little use then for T. S. Eliot. I’ve never been able to develop a real liking for him. I had some kind of admiration for W. B. Yeats, but certainly my heart was not with them as it was with the American poets.	Layton
2208.834188		Another thing that bound us was a kind of realism, a desire to describe the world as we saw it. Louis and I were both fortunate enough to be brought up in the slummy areas of Montreal. We knew something about prostitutes and drunks and crime and the more sordid aspects of urban life. And we were turning against the landscape poetry of Carmen and Roberts and so on. We wanted to express the urban reality.	Layton
2242.430637		And finally, of course, there was the left-wing orientation. Like the poets of Preview we were socialist in our outlook—left-wing in our outlook—I was a Marxist. Louis was not quite a Marxist but sympathetic. John Sutherland embraced Marxism, and largely because I was his brother-in-law, and also because I was always thundering at him, you know, excerpts from The Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital and The Class Struggles in France and all that. So these were the things that bound us together.	Layton
2275.528899		There was a great deal of rivalry between Preview and First Statement. They were the older writers—F. R. Scott, A. M. Klein, A. J. M. Smith. And there was Patrick Anderson, and I have to pay my tribute, my respects to Patrick Anderson. He was an Englishman and he came hot with the gospel right off the griddle of Dylan Thomas and the left-wing poets, Auden and Spender and people like that. We had not even heard of them—at least I hadn’t. And he knew the European poets. He knew poets like Stefan George and Rilke, and—oh, he was a blazing meteor that burst into the sky and for someone like myself who had never heard—let alone of European poetry—but I had never heard of T. S. Eliot! I mean, the universities were doing then a pretty good job of insulating anyone from any kind of useful or necessary knowledge. So I went through the university without ever hearing of T. S. Eliot. And of course when I was in highschool, not only did I hear of any important English poetry, but I had never heard of Canadian poets like Lampman, or Duncan Campbell Scott, or Sir Charles G. D. Roberts. I was brought up with the notion that to be a poet you had to be either English or dead!	Layton
2361.621746		IL: Imagine me going through the university and never hearing of T. S. Eliot or Auden or any of the important contemporary poets. Well, can you imagine my surprise and my delight in discovering modern poetry? And I discovered it largely through the influence of John Sutherland, and his sister Betty, and I got my first glimpse of Eliot and can you imagine the strangeness of a line like “an evening spread upon the table like an etherized patient”?  How foreign it sounded to somebody who’s brought up on [quoting William Wordsworth] “I wandered as lonely as a cloud / that floats on high.” Or [quoting Lord Alfred Tennyson] “Break, break, break / On thy cold gray stones.”  And coming across Auden—the foreign-ness, the strangeness of Auden’s line “Sir, no man’s enemy, forgiving all / But will his negative inversion”— how strange it sounded, how fascinating, how delightful. And all the surrealism and the fantasy and the imagination and what they were doing with language. That, for me, was the great thrill. And had I not met John through my wife Betty, I dare say I would’ve gone onto become a wealthy multi-millionaire in real estate, or somebody like that, instead of a poor poet.	Layton
2395.031375		IL recites excerpt from "The Wasteland" by T. S. Eliot	Layton
2404.123278		IL recites excerpt from "I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud" by William Wordsworth and "Break Break Break" by Lord Alfred Tennyson	Layton
2417.076125		IL recites excerpt from poem "Sir, No Man's Enemy (Petition Poem)" by W. H. Auden	Layton
2448.337325		It was great. And how wonderful—how wonderful to meet people like A. M. Klein and Frank Scott and Page and Anderson. All of them devoted to the craft of poetry. That’s what they taught me—that poetry was a craft. And their devotion to that craft, that there was something more in life than making money or achieving success, that getting a good poem done was the greatest thing you could accomplish. Having people who felt that way about it. That they survived to—know that somebody like A. M. Klein walked the streets of Montreal, that he was a poet that had been published, and that he had survived.	Layton
2493.111833		You must remember what the climate was then—the literary and cultural desert that Canada was in 1942, 1943. And suddenly to find a group of like-minded men and women who loved poetry, and every time we met at this man’s house or that man’s house, taking out a poem that you had just composed and reading it, and getting their criticism—criticism from those that valued the craft of poetry and had devoted their lives to it. For me, that is the essence of the ‘40s.	Layton
2534.928358		Apart from the rivalries and the jealousies, and the envy, the burning envy when a poet like Patrick Anderson published a poem—like his marvellous poem “Summer’s Joe” or “Canada,” you burned with envy, you wanted to do something better than he had done. Or getting Louis Dudek’s first copy of Unit of Five published along with four other poets and you were excluded. The burning, seething envy, you know?	Layton
2565.006365		Great, great experiences, you see? Where it was that rivalry, it was that competition. But it was competition and rivalry to achieve the best, you see? And that’s a different kind of competition. So you had First Statement and you had Preview and eventually, because we had the press, and they had the prominent writers—the well-known writers like Patrick Anderson and Frank Scott and A. M. Klein and Pat Page and A. J. M. Smith—anthologist, critic, poet. And we were obscure writers then. John Sutherland, Louis Dudek, myself—well, we came together. It was a marriage of convenience. They wanted the press and we wanted to be associated with these great authors. And so that is how Northern Review was formed. And one evening we were all together and somebody remarked, “well, if somebody threw a bomb now, Canadian literature would be put back 50 to 100 years.” 	Layton
2622.982814		IL: You know, we were all there. And then the rivalries that erupted between the old rivalries that had been suppressed that again erupted between the First Statement group and the Preview group, and because of the review that John Sutherland had written over [Robert] Finch’s receiving the Governor General’s medal, the whole Preview group resigned en mass, leaving the original First Statement-ers.	Layton
2653.060821		So there was John Sutherland and myself and Audrey Aikman, his wife, and Betty and Louis Dudek at that time was in New York. And then Louis and I called because John became increasingly religious, Catholic, reactionary. He turned against all the idols that he and I had espoused so vehemently. Nietzsche and Lawrence, you know, modern poetry. Now he had turned his back on that, and of course I couldn’t go along with that. So I resigned and John was left as the editor of Northern Review but this time a different kind of magazine from what it had been originally when First Statement and Northern Review had come together.	Layton
3061.32462		IL: You know the glorious thing, I mean this is no longer true, but how glorious to be alive at a time when you could astound and bewilder an entire country by putting forward two simple propositions, such as: sex is here to stay and sex is enjoyable	Layton
3093.893559		IL: But if you said that at that time, or if you said that a woman had breasts and other delightful things, there was a silence—a shocked silence… almost like the one that happened just now.	Layton
3171.797466		IL: Of course the reason for the popularity of poetry readings is simple, isn’t it? Namely that the rabbis and the ministers and the priests have lost the kind of authority and prestige that they had and poets have really taken the place of the discredited ministers. People go to poetry readings for spiritual uplift. They don’t go—the young people don’t go to churches, they don’t go to the synagogue. There’s no spiritual uplift to be found there. But you might possibly find something like that a poetry reading! So there’s a laying-on of hands, there’s benison and prayer at poetry readings. So in effect I think that poetry readings have taken the place of chapel-going.	Layton
3654.758096		IL: Of course Dorothy is quite right in saying that the Spanish Civil War was a dress rehearsal for the Second World War. The fascists—the Germans and the Italians—were using Spain as a sort of testing ground for their blitzkrieg, and the democracies were asleep. And the poets were aware of what was happening and they knew that what was happening in Spain was heralding World War II.	Layton
3690.502974		But there was another element that was beginning to enter and I think it has to be mentioned because it certainly played a part in my own later development, and in the development of the thinking of both John Sutherland and Louis Dudek. One of the insincerities—one of the hypocrisies, I felt—of Patrick Anderson’s position when he talks about the Preview poets being for democracy was the fact that there was a great support for the Soviet Union at the time because the Soviet Union was regarded as an ally. Joe Stalin and Communism were regarded as allies of the democracies so we didn’t look too closely into their credentials. But in the latter part of the decade it was becoming quite clear to me that Joe Stalin was as blood-thirsty a dictator as Hitler had been. And that Joe Stalin and the Bolsheviks had killed more people, more innocent people than Hitler, and Mussolini.	Layton
