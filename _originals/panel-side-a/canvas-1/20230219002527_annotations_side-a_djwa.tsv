00:00:45		SD: I wonder if we could have your attention.The subject of tonight’s symposium is “Poetry of the Thirties and Forties”. The poetry that really laid the foundation, in fact started modern poetry, and laid the foundation for the contemporary.	Djwa
00:01:01		We’re fortunate tonight in having here with us some of the major poets from this period. Dorothy Livesay, who began writing in Ontario in the late 20s, Anne Marriott, whose major poem was written in B.C. In 1939, “The Wind Our Enemy,” and Irving Layton who began to write in Montreal in the early 40s.	Djwa
00:01:24		We’re happy to have Anne here substituting for P. K. Page, who wasn’t able to come. And we very much regret that F. R. Scott has been ill, and is not able to be with us.	Djwa
00:01:37		Our format this evening will consist of a brief introduction to each of the three poets, followed by an overview of their particular period by each of the poets. We will then move onto a general discussion with the panel, and after that we will throw the meeting open for questions.	Djwa
00:01:58		Now, I’d like to begin, perhaps, by invoking F. R. Scott in spirit, since he can’t be here in person. Because it was Scott’s satirical verse, “The Canadian Authors Meet,” written in 1927, which really sketches out the kind of poetry that most of our three panelists were reacting against.	Djwa
00:02:20		This was the poem entitled “The Canadian Authors Meet” and it was written at the Ritz Carleton Hotel one night in 1927 while Scott, sitting at the back of the room, watched A. J. M. Smith go up to the front of the room to get two prizes for two sonnets, which he had submitted pseudonymously. The poem that Scott wrote is this:	Djwa
00:02:45		SD recites poem “The Canadian Authors Meet” by F. R. Scott.	Djwa
00:03:44		SD: Well, Scott was parodying the kind of poetry that he didn’t care for.	Djwa
00:03:50		Dorothy Livesay who is going to begin tonight’s symposium will be telling us something about the Miss Crotchets, the lady poets of the 20s, who preceded her.	Djwa
00:04:01		More importantly, she will be telling us about another strain of poetry - an important imagist line that began with Raymond Knister that carried on through W. W. E Ross, and also she will be talking about, briefly, the poetry of Louise Morey Bowman.	Djwa
00:04:19		SD: Dorothy knows the world of the woman artist firsthand, because her mother, Florence Randal Livesay was a well-known poet of the 20s. Her father, J. F. B. Livesay was for some time a head of Canadian Press.	Djwa
00:04:33		Dorothy’s first book of poetry, Green Pitcher was published in 1928. It differs from the earlier verse—much of the earlier verse of the 20s—in that you will find here an original voice which draws on the new imagist movement for its form.	Djwa
00:04:51		Early in the 30s she became committed to the left. Her poetry, which had earlier concentrated on nature, now turned to human nature. And particularly the social struggle and its place in a reconstructed society.	Djwa
00:05:07		She was associated with the short-lived little magazine Masses, which ran from 1932 to ’34, and with the left-wing New Frontier of 1937.	Djwa
00:05:19		It was her poem, “Day and Night,” a description of the toiling factory worker, which for many Canadians epitomized what was wrong with the industrial system.	Djwa
00:05:30		SD recites excerpt from “Day and Night” by Dorothy Livesay.	Djwa
00:05:37		The whole fascinating story of these years is to be found in her recently published book, Right Hand Left Hand, a montage of letters, documents, and clippings from the period.	Djwa
00:05:49		In 1941, Dorothy was one of the founders of Contemporary Verse, that British Columbia little magazine which was one of the first to decentralize Canadian poetry. Her collected poems, The Two Seasons, was published in 1972. She received two Governor General’s awards: one for Day and Night in 1944 (the book this time, not the poem); and in 1947 for her Poems for People. She received the Queen’s Jubilee medal in 1977.	Djwa
00:06:21		Through her candor and her explicit statement of the woman’s position, Dorothy Livesay has had a considerable influence on younger woman poets in the 60s and 70s. Tonight she will be describing the literary climate of the 20s and some of the more exciting events of the 30s. Dorothy Livesay.	Djwa
00:16:11		SD: I think that when we get through hearing each of the panelists in turn it might be a good idea to go back to you, Dorothy, and to ask you more about the ‘30s and especially the Spanish Civil War and the way in which it had an influence here in Canada.	Djwa
00:16:28		SD: To introduce our second panelist, Anne Marriott: Anne comes to poetry with a somewhat different perspective than either Dorothy or Irving in that she didn’t hold a particular ideological position during what was really a highly political decade—the ‘30s.	Djwa
00:16:48		SD: She is a B.C. writer, educated in Victoria at Norfolk House and she later took courses in creative writing at the University of British Columbia.	Djwa
00:16:58		During a summer visit to the prairies, she experienced some of the effects of a long depression and drought. It was near the end of the ‘30s when she was in the prairies. Her poem “The Wind, Our Enemy,” one of the best known poems of that decade, is a word painting of her own emotional reaction.	Djwa
00:17:18		She received the Governor General’s award for her chapbook Calling Adventurers in 1941 and published Salt Marsh in 1942 and published Sandstone and Other Poems in 1945.	Djwa
00:17:31		In “The Wind, Our Enemy” Anne writes from the perspective of one who feels with and for the prairie farmer as the sun beats down destroying his crop.	Djwa
00:17:43		But on the other hand, she hasn’t forgotten—as some of our writers of the Depression have—the, sort of, enormous human solidarity. There were dances, there were get-togethers, there were soirees in “The Wind, Our Enemy.”	Djwa
00:17:58		She will be describing her approach to her art and her part with Dorothy Livesay in the setting-up of Contemporary Verse.	Djwa
00:18:07		I should mention, as a matter of interest, that all three of our panelists were together, in the pages of Contemporary Verse in 1941. Anne Marriott.	Djwa
00:26:45		SD: That was a darn good magazine!	Djwa
00:26:58		SD: Well, shortly after Contemporary Verse got going and Irving Layton and Dorothy Livesay and Anne Marriott appeared in its pages, Preview, a new little magazine was founded in Montreal.	Djwa
00:27:09		As P. K. Page is not here to tell the Preview story, perhaps we should have a few sentences on it. Preview began in March 1942 as a mimeograph bulletin. F. R. Scott, Patrick Anderson, and Neville Shaw were among the original founders, and P. K. Page and A. M. Klein soon joined the group.	Djwa
00:27:31		The first editorial of this little magazine stated that the poets involved were all anti-fascist, and this is what they said: “We feel that the existence of a war between democratic culture and the paralyzing forces of dictatorship only intensifies the writer’s obligation to work. Now more than ever, creative and experimental writing must be kept alive and there must be no retreat.”	Djwa
00:27:39		SD quoting Preview editors	Djwa
00:27:57		World War II, then, brought with it a new interest in the arts, especially poetry and especially poetry in the service of democracy.	Djwa
00:28:07		First Statement, a second little magazine began shortly after Preview, partly, as Irving will probably tell us, because John Sutherland, the founder of First Statement submitted some poems to Preview and they weren’t accepted. So he then decided he needed an outlet for his poetry and First Statement came into being.	Djwa
00:28:32		First Statement also took a political stand. However, the cosmopolitanism, especially the British influence of the Preview group irked First Statement members, especially John Sutherland, Irving Layton, and Louis Dudek. They saw Preview’s cosmopolitanism as just another name for colonialism.	Djwa
00:28:55		As John Sutherland wrote: “a poet preaching politics in the guise of Auden may be just as colonial as a member of the CAA praising Britain in the metres of Tennyson.” What Sutherland wanted was a poetry that stopped being a parasite on other literatures and has had the courage to decide its own problems in its own way.	Djwa
00:28:57		SD quotes John Sutherland	Djwa
00:29:18		Irving Layton, who began to write in the pages of First Statement, and in fact in the early years of the war as Lieutenant Layton can best speak of this period.	Djwa
00:29:32		He hardly needs an introduction to this audience as many of you will have heard his excellent reading last night. In the early ‘40s, Irving was writing particularly of the social injustices, which he perceived in Montreal and in the larger world around him.	Djwa
00:29:48		In the April 1943 issue of First Statement, we find a verse from Irving called “The Modern Poet” and here are the first four lines:	Djwa
00:29:58		SD recites excerpt from "The Modern Poet" by Irving Layton.	Djwa
00:30:07		Irving Layton, is, above all, a passionate poet. And his great contribution to Canadian literature is that he brought eros to Canadian poetry, where she properly belonged.	Djwa
00:30:32		In the early ‘40s and late ‘50s he complained that Canadians were “too dull, too conservative, and much too neglectful of the joys of the flesh.”	Djwa
00:30:42		In pastorals such as “Look, The Lambs Are All About Us,” he set out to educate Canadians: “Hell, my back sunburnt from so much lovemaking in the open air. What luck, what luck to be loved by the one girl in this Presbyterian country who knows how to give a man pleasure”	Djwa
