So they were laying the basis—this populist movement of prose writers—were laying the basis, I think, for all that happened afterwards—the fact that the Canadian novel really came to birth on the prairie in Manitoba, with the descendants of Martha Ostenso, the descendants of Laura Goodman Salverson, the descendants of Mazo de la Roche in Ontario. People who wrote for the people, but did not write brilliant literary pieces of work, but they laid the basis, I believe, for Margaret Lawrence, for Adele Wiseman, for Gabrielle Roy, and the Canadian novel came to birth and to long life.",
