## Annotating Literary History
### Canadian Modernism of the 1930s and 1940s
In 1978, the poets Dorothy Livesay, Anne Marriott, and Irving Layton were invited to Simon Fraser University to take part in a panel discussion on the history of Canadian modernism in the 1930s and 1940s. The project explores how AudiAnnotateâ€™s digital annotation workflow can gesture towards an understanding of the panel recording as a site of negotiation between the three poets, whose combined voices present an oral document of modernist literary history, and which unveils the extent to which their positions as modernists are re-articulated within the context of the present time of the recording. Meanwhile, the digitally adapted transcription works to map the rich constellation of the literary communities, cultural institutions, and historical conditions that inform each of the panelist's respective modernist narratives.
